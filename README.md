# Decentralized Education Credential Verification System

## Overview
The **Decentralized Education Credential Verification System** is a blockchain-based platform that enables the issuance, management, and verification of educational credentials. It leverages smart contracts to ensure secure and tamper-proof credential verification, with NFTs representing individual credentials or significant educational achievements.

## Features
- **Credential Management Platform**:
    - Educational institutions can issue and manage digital credentials.
    - Employers can verify credentials seamlessly.
- **Smart Contracts**:
    - **Credential Issuance**: Institutions can issue blockchain-based credentials.
    - **Verification Mechanism**: Employers and organizations can verify credentials securely.
    - **Revocation System**: Credentials can be revoked if necessary.
- **NFT Integration**:
    - **Credential Representation**: NFTs represent degrees, diplomas, and certifications.
    - **Achievement Recognition**: Notable educational achievements can be tokenized.
- **Institutional Integration**:
    - Direct collaboration with universities and companies for seamless verification.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solana, or Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity, Clarity
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage
- **NFTs**: ERC-721/ERC-1155 for credential representation
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API interactions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for off-chain metadata

## How It Works
1. **Credential Issuance**:
    - Educational institutions issue credentials as NFTs.
    - Data is stored securely on the blockchain.
2. **Verification & Access**:
    - Employers and institutions verify credentials via smart contracts.
    - Students can share credentials easily with verification links.
3. **Revocation & Updates**:
    - Institutions can revoke or update credentials if necessary.
    - Changes are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Solidity/Clarity development environment
- IPFS or Arweave setup

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/decentralized-credential-system.git
   cd decentralized-credential-system
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Deploy smart contracts:
   ```sh
   npx hardhat deploy
   ```
4. Start the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Enhancements
